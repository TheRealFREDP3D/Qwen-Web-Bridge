# üß† Qwen Bridge: VSCode Extension to Free AI Web Chat

The Qwen Bridge system enables AI-powered code assistance within VSCode using a local proxy and browser automation. Instead of calling paid OpenAI APIs, it interacts with a free web chat interface (like ChatGPT or Claude) using Puppeteer, emulating an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

---

## üöÄ Overview Workflow

This project uses a local bridge that:

- Accepts API-style requests from a VSCode extension (e.g., Cline)
- Automates browser interaction with a web-based AI chat
- Parses and returns the response as if it came from OpenAI's API

| `QwenProxyServer`      | Local server emulating OpenAI API                                           |
| `QwenClient`           | Bridge client that controls the browser and processes requests              |
| `Puppeteer`            | Headless browser automation library used to interact with the chat webpage |
| Web Chat Interface     | Target (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude) free web interface                           |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- `qwen-proxy.enableScreenshots` (boolean, default: false):
  - If enabled, the extension will capture screenshots at key browser automation steps (e.g., after navigation, before submitting a message).
  - Only the 20 most recent screenshots are retained; older screenshots are deleted automatically.
  - Useful for debugging, but can consume disk space if left enabled.
  - Recommended to keep disabled in CI or production environments.
- All logs from QwenClient now appear in the VSCode Output panel under "QwenClient Output" (View ‚Üí Output ‚Üí QwenClient Output).

---

## üß™ Testing

- Unit tests for QwenClient now mock Puppeteer browser and page methods to simulate errors and edge cases, improving reliability and speed.
- Screenshot retention policy: only the 20 most recent screenshots are kept; older ones are deleted automatically.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations

- Ensure you comply with the Terms of Service of any AI platform you interact with.
- Expect occasional breakage from site changes or CAPTCHAs.
- Add retry/backoff logic and rate limiting for safety.

---

## üìÇ Roadmap

- [x] Puppeteer successfully connects to Qwen website
- [x] Basic message sending works reliably
- [x] Authentication flow is robust and user-friendly
- [x] Selectors are resilient to minor UI changes
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage for the Qwen client
- [x] Clear documentation for testing and troubleshooting
- [ ] Add support for multiple chat UIs (Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- [ ] Snapshot/restore chat sessions
- [ ] Toggle between local LLM and web chat backends
- [ ] Authentication via stored cookies/session replay

## [0.3.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Automated Endpoint Tests: Introduced Jest and Supertest-based automated tests for server endpoints (`/health`, `/v1/models`, `/status`, `/v1/chat/completions`). Each endpoint has its own test file in the `test/` directory for clarity and maintainability.
- VSCode Mocking for Tests: Added Jest manual mock for the `vscode` module to enable isolated server testing.
- Testing Documentation: Updated setup-dev-guide.md with instructions for running and maintaining automated tests.

### Changed

- Refactored QwenClient: Major refactoring of the Qwen client for better organization. Replaced `playwright-core` with `puppeteer` to match project dependencies. The client is now more robust with distinct `initialize` and `cleanup` methods.

### Fixed

- TypeScript Configuration: Corrected TypeScript configuration to allow for DOM types, resolving compilation errors.

## üí¨ Example Use Case

1. Developer types: `"Explain the difference between map and flatMap in JavaScript"`
2. Cline sends request to QwenProxyServer
3. Browser automation submits it to ChatGPT
4. Response is extracted and returned to the extension
5. Seamless integration without OpenAI API costs
