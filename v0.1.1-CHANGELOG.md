## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Improved error handling
- Rate limiting
- Response caching
- Model selection
- Conversation history
- Performance optimizations

## [0.1.2] - 2025-06-21

### Added
- **Cookie Persistence**: The Qwen client now saves and loads cookies to maintain login sessions across restarts.
- **Manual Login Command**: Added a "Qwen Proxy: Open Browser to Login" command to easily open a non-headless browser for manual authentication.
- **Clear Cookies Command**: Added a "Qwen Proxy: Clear Cookies" command.
- **Streaming Support**: Implemented response streaming from the Qwen web interface.
- **VSCode Extension Context**: The client now accepts an `ExtensionContext` for better integration with VSCode's state and storage.

### Changed
- **Refactored QwenClient**: Major refactoring of the Qwen client for better organization. Replaced `playwright-core` with `puppeteer` to match project dependencies. The client is now more robust with distinct `initialize` and `cleanup` methods.
- **Configuration Update**: The `openBrowser` command now correctly uses `await` when updating the configuration to prevent race conditions.
- **Robust Cleanup**: The `cleanup` method now uses a `try...finally` block to ensure the client state is reset correctly, even if errors occur.
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Corrected TypeScript configuration to allow for DOM types, resolving compilation errors.
